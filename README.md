# simple_social_media
An upgraded version of blog_project using python django framework, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and bootstrap.
I have created this project using the help of a tutorial of Udemy. 
In this project an user can signup, login, create groups about various topics(eg. Nasa,pluto etc.) 
User can leave and join other groups.
It has multiple users and authorizations. users can also see whos is commenting and what time are they commenting.
